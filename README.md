#  Supervised learning classification on how to predict the possibility of tumor severity.

Model used for classification is :
1.  Logistic Regression
2.  KNN
3.  Decision Tree

After that we define which model is best to predict the cancer based on accuracy test.

# Conclusion
After defining the feature and target, accuracy score for all 3 models is :
1.  Logistic Regression : 91.228%

2.  KNN : - Without Scaling : 73.684%
          - With Scaling : 89.473%

3.  Decision Tree : 87.719%

Best model for predicting tumor severity based on the data is by using Logistic Regression because it has the highest accuracy score between all model.
